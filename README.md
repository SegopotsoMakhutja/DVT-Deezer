## overview
##### [Demo](https://segopotso-dvt-deezer.vercel.app/)
##### [Link to project repo](https://github.com/SegopotsoMakhutja/DVT-Deezer)

### possible bugs
- sometimes the search input requires you to click on it twice for the search to run. <- added as a chaallenge faced.
<br/>

### Deezer is an internet-based music streaming service.  You are required to implement an Angular app to explore its database.

<br />

1.  Users should be able to search for artists.  For every artist found **show the artist's picture and the number of fans they have**.  On bigger screens, with more available space, **also include the total number of albums**.

<br />

2.  Clicking/tapping the artist must allow users to see basic information about them, like its total number of fans.  Also show its top 5 tracks along with a list of all their albums.  For every album include the year in which it was released.
